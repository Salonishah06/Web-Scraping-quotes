Our lives are increasingly shaped by it and how it is defined, collected and used. But who counts in the collection, analysis and application of data?This important book is the first to look at queer data – defined as data relating to gender, sex, sexual orientation and trans identity/history. The author shows us how current data practices reflect an incomplete account of LGBTQ lives and helps us understand how data biases are used to delegitimise the everyday experiences of queer people.Guyan demonstrates why it is important to understand, collect and analyse queer data, the benefits and challenges involved in doing so, and how we might better use queer data in our work. Arming us with the tools for action, this book shows how greater knowledge about queer identities is instrumental in informing decisions about resource allocation, changes to legislation, access to services, representation and visibility.<\\\\/span>\\\\n  <a data-text-id=\\\\\"15149806813467424776\\\\\" href=\\\\\"#\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"swapContent(\\\\$(this));; return false;\\\\\">...more<\\\\/a>\\\\n\\\\n    <\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n      <div class=\\\\\\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\\\\\\' id=\\\\\\'14_book_57917062\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrUp wtrLeft\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"G2HBUaq/AXe0/ujW5DqzcUyYrbZzSu0zRo9FNfPkyqj+8mX7sfyqxEcHV3SCi1sU2WOG5HS8J367hJL/z9VJxw==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"57917062\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" value=\\\\\"to-read\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"14_book_57917062\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" id=\\\\\"wtr_new\\\\\" value=\\\\\"true\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" id=\\\\\"ref\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrLeftUpRef\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" id=\\\\\"existing_review\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" class=\\\\\"wtrExisting\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/quotes/tag\\\\\" />\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrToRead\\\\\\' type=\\\\\\'submit\\\\\\'>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressTrigger\\\\\\'>Want to Read<\\\\/span>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\'progressIndicator\\\\\\'>saving…<\\\\/span>\\\\n<\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'wtrRight wtrUp\\\\\\'>\\\\n<form class=\\\\\"hiddenShelfForm\\\\\" action=\\\\\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\\\\\" accept-charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\" method=\\\\\"post\\\\\"><input name=\\\\\"utf8\\\\\" type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" value=\\\\\"&#x2713;\\\\\" /><input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"authenticity_token\\\\\" value=\\\\\"ifdN6PbI75Hr+9J2+kui+39/1MIPvUMO6nrXLloQ1oFsZOlC7YtEIhgCbdSc+kqe6oT/kAhLiUMXcQDkZiFV7g==\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"unique_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"14_book_57917062\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" id=\\\\\"book_id\\\\\" value=\\\\\"57917062\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"a\\\\\" id=\\\\\"a\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"name\\\\\" id=\\\\\"name\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_choice\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" id=\\\\\"from_home_module\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" />\\\\n<input type=\\\\\"hidden\\\\\" name=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" id=\\\\\"page_url\\\\\" value=\\\\\"/quotes/tag\\\\\" />\\\\n<\\\\/form>\\\\n\\\\n<button class=\\\\\\'wtrShelfButton\\\\\\'><\\\\/button>\\\\n<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'ratingStars wtrRating\\\\\\'>\\\\n<div class=\\\\\\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\\\\\\'>\\\\nError rating book.
